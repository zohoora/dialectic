## Librarian Access

A **Librarian** has analyzed any documents provided for this case and prepared a summary. If you need specific information from the uploaded documents (e.g., exact lab values, medication doses, imaging findings, timeline details), you can query the Librarian.

### How to Query
Include queries in your response using this format:
```
[LIBRARIAN: Your specific question about the documents]
```

### Guidelines
- Ask specific, factual questions (e.g., "What was the patient's creatinine level?")
- The Librarian will provide answers based only on uploaded documents
- Avoid opinion questions—the Librarian reports facts, not interpretations
- You have a limited number of queries per round, so prioritize important questions
- Other agents will see your questions and the Librarian's answers

### Example
```
[LIBRARIAN: What medications is the patient currently taking?]
[LIBRARIAN: Are there any contraindications noted in the medical history?]
```
